## Guidelines for Educational Use of AI

### University of Texas at Austin

[Acceptable Use of ChatGPT and Similar AI Tools](https://security.utexas.edu/ai-tools){:target="_blank"}

{: .attention}
> **Quote:** With the increasing integration of artificial intelligence (AI) tools—such as ChatGPT, Copilot, Bard Gemini, Claude and other generative AI applications known as large language models (LLM), diffusion models, or generative AI applications—into university activities, it's essential to use these technologies responsibly. This guidance ... outlines acceptable practices for utilizing generative AI tools while safeguarding institutional, personal, and proprietary information.

[ChatGPT and Generative AI Tools: Sample Syllabus Policy Statements](https://ctl.utexas.edu/chatgpt-and-generative-ai-tools-sample-syllabus-policy-statements){:target="_blank"}

{: .attention}
> **Quote:** ... While generative AI tools can offer inspiration and new possibilities, they should not be seen as unacknowledged substitutes for the content created by students in their courses... [We] recommend that UT faculty and instructors decide whether or not these tools fit within their pedagogical aims and clearly state their course policies in a designated section of their syllabi...

### Cornell

Cornell created three task forces on the use of generative AI for research, education, and administration. Each task force created a report that can be found [here](https://ai.cornell.edu/generative-ai/){:target="_blank"}.

{: .attention}
> **Quote:** Nobody knows the true impact that generative AI will have on education and research. These technologies are rapidly evolving in complexity and type of use. What we do know is that generative AI is opening up a world of possibilities, while also generating significant concerns about academic integrity, ethics, access and bias.

### ETH Zürich 

The ETH Zürich library team created a web site [AI in Teaching and Learning](https://ethz.ch/en/the-eth-zurich/education/ai-in-education.html){:target="_blank"} on using AI ethically and effectively.
  
{: .attention}
> **Quote:** ETH Zurich advocates a proactive approach to the use of generative AI (GenAI) within educational contexts, emphasising the responsible use of this technology among students and lecturers.
