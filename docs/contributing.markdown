# How to Contribute to this Catalog

We welcome your contributions! This website catalogs various guidelines, academic programs, and other assets used at many academic institutions, for guide and assist in the use of AI in both classroom and research settings.

There are several ways to suggest additions:

* Post a [pull request](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/academic-assets-for-AI/pulls){:target="prs"}! 
	* For corrections to website pages and "small" additions, every page has an _Edit this page on GitHub_ link, which goes straight to the page's source. You can make your edits there and submit a PR easily. This is the best and fastest way to help us fix typos and add content.
* Post a [discussion topic](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/academic-assets-for-AI/discussions){:target="discussions"}. Start a discussion topic about your proposed addition or change. If you have suggestions about improving the organization of the content or other larger changes, this is a good way to start.
* Post an [issue](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/academic-assets-for-AI/issues){:target="issues"} 
	* See also the [project board](https://github.com/orgs/The-AI-Alliance/projects/39/){:target="dashboard"}
* Send us [email](mailto:contact@thealliance.ai?subject=Suggestions for the Academic Assets for AI website). This is a general email address, so be sure to mention this particular project so your email gets routed to the correct people. However, the link automatically adds the project name to the subject line.

For general information about contributing to AI Alliance projects, visit [this `community` repo](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/community/){:target="community"}, specifically the [`CONTRIBUTING` page](https://github.com/The-AI-Alliance/community/blob/main/CONTRIBUTING.md){:target="community"} for general information about contributing.
